//3. codepen.io to put the code there and then share the link
//10. min8. variables cannot start with numbers
//They can only contain num strings (not JS keywords; if you want one you need to use _ or & at first) _ or $
//also avoid name, even if it's allowed // real const with upper case (like PI)
//12. there are only two values: object or primitive // js is dynamic and vars can be reasigned to even another data type
//min.10:30 the typeof operator
//reassignements do not need let or var. only the name of the var.
//undefined is a type
//typeof null is an object because of a bug that won't change because of legacy reasons
//13. min4. you cannot craete empty const
//never create a new var without let/const
//Use const for Objects Arrays and functions and do changes but not reassignements
//14. console.log(var1, var2, var3)
//_** means power of, *= as += but with *, x-- as x++ but substracting

//min5. double undefined assignement: let x, y
//17. min5. template literals with `I'm ${firstName}` also this ticks can be usted for regular strings, so you basically use them always in the end
//min10. you can change line with \n\ on a string. either this or just using template literals and ENTER

//20. Type conversion and coercion
//Number(string) to convert '999' to 999. The string var keeps benig the same '999'. So the Number only applies at that point
//NaN means not a number or invalid number (even if the typeof is a Number(...))
//String(number) to convert 999 to '999'
//Boolean(0) etc.
//type coercion. sometimes js do changes automatically, like "str" + 23 + "str", the result is "str" + "23" + "str"; or '23' - '10' - 3 is 23 - 10 - 3
//wierdly, the minus operators turn strings to numbers and backwards
//21. Falsy values: 0, '', undifined, null, NaN this means that they are false if they were a boolean. So you can use them for conditions
//22. Equality operators === strict: no type coersion; == does type coersion, so '18' == 18 is true
//try to avoid this last one and just do changes manually with === if needed
//min6. the prompt("What's your age?") function to get data from the user. so if you want a number for sure you can put the prompt inside the Number function
//const age = Number(prompt("what's your age")); by doing this, age is a number, otherwise it's a string
//_!== strict oppossito of ===, so it's a doesn't equal; != is the loose version
//23. Switch Statement
const day = 'monday';
switch (day) {
  case 'Monday': // day === 'monday' it's always strict
    console.log('today is monday');

let ageX = 20;

//this first part is called the condition. It's the same thing you put in brackets after an if
//it's an expression; it has a value. And you can create conditioned vars; that's the real use actually
let myDrink = age >= 20 ? 'wine' : 'water';
//VS (to see the difference on how to assign a conditioned var) Still notice that you can still do reassignements in both

//39. Data structure: OBJECTS

//70. DOM Manipulation
//most of the times you assign these to a var.
// & THE DOT IS ONLY FOR THE SELECTOR!
document.querySelector('.class');
document.querySelector('#id');
document.querySelector('.class').textContent; //to see what's inside but formated
document.querySelector('.class').innerHTML; //to see what's inside as shown in the HTML; don't use this one for input! A user could mess around.
//but it works really well for changing many attributes at once.
document.querySelector('.class').innerText; //to see what text is inside, no matter who 'has' it
document.querySelector('.class').textContent = 'new text'; //to change what's inside
document.querySelector('.class').value; //to get the inserted value from an input. I don't know how it works for other elements
document.querySelector('.class').addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log('');
}); //'listens to a click
document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = '#ffffff'; //always the value is a string here and the property written in camel case
//this is called inline styling, so inside HTML
document.getElementById('only-an-ID'); //here you don't need a . or #, but you need it using the querySelector
document.getElementsByClassName('only-a-class-name'); //same as above
//78. Refactoring (cleaning the code)
//In order to avoid having all these (similar) lines from above, you can create a function. For example: instead of:
document.querySelector('.class').textContent = 'new text'; //everytime you want to do this to the same class, you can rather create this:
const displayMessage = function (message) {
  document.querySelector('.class').textContent = message;
};
//and then use it as
displayMessage('new-text1');
displayMessage('new-text2');
displayMessage('new-text3');
//Also, using vars for query selectors. So instead of having this:
document.querySelector('.classAC');
//you can have this
const classAC = document.querySelector('.class');
//if you want to add/remove classes to classAC:
classAC.classList.add('hidden');
classAC.classList.remove('hidden');
classAC.classList.toggle('hidden');
//very useful condition for if statements
classAC.classList.contains('hidden');
!classAC.classList.contains('hidden');
//IMPORTANT! If you use QUERY SELECTOR only the first element that has this class will be selected, not the others. In that case you have to use
document.querySelectorAll('.class-that-is-used-in-more-places');
document.querySelectorAll('[hereYouCanPutAnAtt]');
//then if you need to do a change in all you need a for loop since what's selected becomes an array of each element w that class (very annoying, but that's what it seems)
//webdevsim uses Array.from() when doing the selection
//81. Hear key pressing
document.addEventListener('keydown', function () {}); //there's also keypress and keyup; self-explanatory
//EVENTS are not explained on the course so we jump to youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiOlaiscqDY&ab_channel=dcode
//Events are actions potencially taken by the user (or by an API), like a click or a key press. HTML has them too as attributes but it's not recommended to use them.
//When you pass a function like the above, the argument is always the EVENT object. Normally they are repressented with an arrow f
document.addEventListener('keydown', e => {});
//in order to make things move when a specific key is pressed, you need to beware the key property, so e.key. For example:
document.addEventListener('keydown', e => {
  if (e.key === 'Escape') {
    console.log('do this or that');
  }
});
//82. min4. Flow chart (or everything that can happen). Is like a roadmap of all possibilities. http://diagrams.net
//When a var from a querySelector has an El at the end means you are referring to an element so you can later differeneciate between 'normal' vars and references
//How to change a HTML attribute:
classAC.src = `dice-${dice}.png`;
//so basically it's only dot . and the attribute you want to change and assign it a string
//also the above serve as example of a DYNAMIC SELECTOR. That's using a template literal to fill numbers and change what's selected depending on a var. Another e.g.:
document.getElementById(`current--${activePlayer}`).textContent = currentScore;
//86. Using functions only to set values from vars, like a reset button, and put them as a callback. Like: if this happens, all this values go as such
