* I don't want the logo to move

102 example of the above for step 1 and 2
103 step 3
104 step 4

105 responsive design principles (% & max-width & rem)
106 max width -> when the v touches the width, the element starts to adapt to the parent (v) width. If not, it stays the same (that's why is different from %)
rem explanation and accessibiity. Super important!!!

108 when doing a double reference to a class use -- like btn btn--action btn --reference
108 min 19:30 trick to add borders inside so the layout doesn't move when the border appears (box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px #000)
108 in 23:00 transitions explained
108 using classes for re-usable margins, so they stay outside of the 'core' class. Always add !important si adding the class always works.
* 108 ALWAYS ADD WIDTH!!! Some browsers need both
109 min 16 overlapping
111 navegation
111 min 11 double class (it means it needs both; is like creating another one then) .class1.class2

* 114 at the end. More pseudo elements examples (you can only use before or after once)
* 114 min 24 padding-bottom trick
115 min13 filter atribute for imgs and opacity to go from black to grey
116 min18 how to install ionicons
* 117 min 1 paint an icon with fill or stroke or color (in that case all the text atributes work)
* 117 overflow for images inside containers min12
124 background images need new atr on the html so the picture is still 'described' those are role="img" and aria-label(as "alt", the one used on images)


*DO A CONTAINER (ELEMENT AS DIV, AND CLASS w/) AND PUT IT ALWAYS AS A PARENT ELEMENT OF WHATEVER YOU DO IS A GOOD IDEA
.container {
  /* 1140px */
  max-width: 120rem;
  padding: 0 3.2rem;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
