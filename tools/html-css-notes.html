* transition curves)

XXX MEDIA QUERIES
nice source of info about media queries
https://zellwk.com/blog/media-query-units/
about em and rem
https://zellwk.com/blog/rem-vs-em/

*DO A CONTAINER (ELEMENT AS DIV, AND CLASS w/) AND PUT IT ALWAYS AS A PARENT ELEMENT OF WHATEVER YOU DO IS A GOOD IDEA
.container {
  /* 1140px */
  max-width: 120rem;
  padding: 0 3.2rem;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

*DON'T USE FLEXBOX FOR EVERYTHING CAUSE WITH A GRID IT'S EASIER LATER TO MAKE IT RESPONSIVE

THE REASON YOU DON'T USE DISPLAY TO APPEAR THINGIES IS BECAUSE THE TRANSITIONS DON'T WORK WITH THAT
