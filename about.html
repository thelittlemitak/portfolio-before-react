            Yes! I wanted to create a real world project to keep myself motivated and big enough to include all the technologies that I learnt.

            It all started with frontend development,
            but it happened naturally that after finishing my frontend studies and started this website,
            I just kept going and began with backend courses.
            Then I realized I could apply what I learnt about backend to this website
            to make it completely functional.

            Yes! I think that if you really love something, you can always do it by yourself.
            I do the same with music.

            First YouTube.
            Then I went to Udemy to have more structure, 
            to then come back to YouTube and Google for the little nuances.
            But I would refer to Udemy as my real 'instructor'; 
            that's were I spent most of the time.

            No!
            But it took me a while to take the decision of getting into it full time.
            Basically because I discovered it relatively late in life.
            Since it was something very new, I wanted to be very sure about it.
            But I fell in love with it naturally and slowly.
            In the end, it was meant to be.

            When I saw that Stardew Valley (my favorite game) was done by only one person.
            That blew my mind so I started with C just right after because I wanted
            to be able to do the same.
